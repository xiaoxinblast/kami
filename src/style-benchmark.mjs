/**
 * Paired benchmark for style-profile drafts.
 *
 * Until now the promotion machinery only ever tested `translation_skills` —
 * retrieval limits, extra instructions, QA thresholds. The object that actually
 * carries the house style, `style_profiles`, was activated on a human eyeballing
 * two paragraphs of prose, with no holdout, no regression check and no rollback
 * signal. This module runs a draft profile against the active one through the
 * same paired-benchmark and gate machinery the skill loop already uses.
 *
 * Two rules make the comparison honest:
 *
 * 1. ONLY the style profile differs. Both variants use the current champion
 *    skill, the same holdout cases and the same isolated retrieval, so any
 *    metric delta is attributable to the profile text.
 *
 * 2. The AIQA judge keeps reading the ACTIVE profile for both variants. AIQA
 *    receives the style profile as its nuance yardstick, so letting the draft
 *    grade its own output would make "QA 分不得下降" self-fulfilling — a draft
 *    saying "be verbose" would score verbose output highly. Judging both by the
 *    incumbent standard keeps qa_score meaningful as a REGRESSION GUARD, and
 *    pushes the burden of proving improvement onto edit distance against the
 *    human final, which no profile can influence.
